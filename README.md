Tired of not having enough space on you laptop due to old photos. I created a simple Screenshot Manager that deletes old photos. 
Old photo is subjective so the default amount of days is 200 days, but you can customize it to your liking. 
To run the code, you just need to download all 3 files, saving both input.html and screenshot.html into a template folder and should be all good to go!
Hope this app helps!
